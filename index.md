<h1 style="margin-top:.25rem;">SEER Data Hackathon</h1>

<p style="max-width:60ch;color:#475569;">
A friendly, fast-paced weekend where students from various fields can work together on SEER cancer registry questions. All data is public and open-access, so no IRB approval is required to get started! Bring a laptop and your curiosity, no background in data science is required. We'll help you connect with a team, find a research question, explore the data and shape findings into a short abstract you can keep building on.

## What you’ll do

- Get oriented to the SEER dataset and what kinds of questions it’s good at answering.  
- Form a small team with a mix of skills and interests.  
- Run simple, honest first looks at the data to see what looks promising.  
- Turn early patterns into clear tables/figures.  
- Draft a concise abstract you can refine after the event.

## Who should attend

- Undergrads, grad students, medical students, and MPH/biostats students—plus anyone who enjoys data, health, or both.  
- We aim for **mixed teams** including both **coding** and **clinical** perspectives.
- If you have a team in mind already, all the better!
